# Movie_recommender_system
A collaborative mini-project that implements a **content-based recommender system** for movies.   The system uses **TF-IDF vectorization** (and optionally embeddings) to build item profiles from movie metadata (e.g., plot summaries, genres, or tags) and recommends similar movies based on **cosine similarity**.
