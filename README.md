# 🎬 Movie Recommender System

A collaborative mini-project that implements a **content-based recommender system** for movies.  
The system uses **TF-IDF vectorization** (and optionally embeddings) to build item profiles from movie metadata (e.g., plot summaries, genres, or tags) and recommends similar movies based on **cosine similarity**.

## 📌 Project Overview
Recommender systems are at the core of many modern platforms such as Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify.  
This project focuses on building a **content-based recommender** using:
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)** for text feature extraction  
- **Cosine Similarity** to measure item similarity  
- (Optional) **Embeddings** with [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/) for semantic similarity  

The goal is to suggest movies that are most similar to a given input movie.

## 🚀 Features
- Content-based movie recommendations using metadata (genres, descriptions, tags)  
- TF-IDF vectorization for item profiles  
- Cosine similarity to rank similar movies  
- Extendable to embeddings for semantic recommendations  
- Modular codebase for easy experimentation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** → Data handling  
- **Scikit-learn** → TF-IDF & similarity metrics  
- **Sentence-Transformers** (optional) → Pretrained embeddings  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** → Prototyping

## 📂 Dataset
We use the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) as the main source of movie data.  

Typical columns include:
- `movieId` → Unique identifier  
- `title` → Movie title  
- `genres` → Movie genres (comma-separated)  
- `tagline/description` (if available)
